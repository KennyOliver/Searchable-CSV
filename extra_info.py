#Found from stack exchange (the only code which I copied!!!) that helped me to construct the search mechanism -- I was extremely confused/stuck when my program would only work for the first record. The main fix was that the massive if chains were in the wrong order, and minor shuffling + setting the temporary false values (as commented earlier) helped to make this program function :)
'''#loop through csv list
for row in csv_file:
    #if current rows 2nd value is equal to input, print that row
    if number == row[1]:
         print(row)'''


#This program took a long time to make (about 4/5 hrs even though it looks simple! - Kenny  Oliver Sat 28th March 2020 at 17:58)
